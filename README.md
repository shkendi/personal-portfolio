# Personal Profile

My challenge for this week is to build a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses.

## My Task

Build a portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

### User Story

```
AS A Frontend developer
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT my site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

### Getting Started

I followed the a step by step order to create my project and deploy it to GitHub Pages as showed below:

1. I created a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to my computer.

2. I downloaded the starter code with a HTML and CSS file in it and opened the HTML file on my browser.

3. At the end I created a README file where I explained the steps I followed to complete my project.


### Coding stage

I started by making the necessary changes to my html file first and then added the style using CSS. I followed the change and check method as I was styling my components. I created four components within my portfolio project: Home, About Me, Portfolio and Contact page. The sceenshots below ilustrate how the pages look like.

 And added a footer with an up arrow btn which brings us to the home page as shown below in the img.

### Future improvements

1. I need to fix the sandwich menu button so it shows the pages when I clich on it and it closes them back again when clicking on it for small screens.

### Deployment

1. When I was ready to deploy, I used the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

2. Next, I navigated to my GitHub repository in the browser and then selected the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

3. On the Settings page, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, selected the `main` branch as my source.

4. Navigated to <my-github-username.github.io/my-repository-name> and I found that my new webpage has gone live! For example, if my GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then my URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
